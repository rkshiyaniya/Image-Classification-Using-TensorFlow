## [Real-time Face Mask Detector](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detector)

* It's binary class classification task - (People Wearing Mask & Without Mask)
* For Face Detection DNN based caffe model has been used.
* For Model training I have used Transfer Learning with 'mobilenet_v2' Neural Network base model with pre-trained weights of 'imagenet'.
* Made it Real-time with the help of OpenCV.

## [GUI App for Multiple Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Multiple-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition)

* It's multi-class classification task - (Predict digit between 0 to 9)
* Dataset Used : MNIST digit
* Deep Learning Model has been built in TensorFlow/Keras from scratch and trained using CNNs.
* With the help of OpenCV it's possible to detect Multiple Digits in Canvas made in tkinter.
* Detected digits are passed to Model for Prediction.

## [Rock-Paper-Scissors Classification Using TensorFlow](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Using-TensorFlow)

* It's multi-class classification task - (Predict Rock, Paper & Scissors)
* Animated Dataset has been used.
* Able to got ~98% Validation accuracy.
* Correclty classify all the unseen images except only 1.
* Note : Data Label - Paper 0, Rock 1, Scissors 2

## [LeNet Architecture Implementation on MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Neural-Network-Architecture-Implementation-for-Image-Classification/blob/main/LeNet_MNIST.ipynb)

* It's multi-class classification task - (Predict digit between 0 to 9)
* LeNet Architecture has been used for Image Classification on MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

## [MiniVGGNet Architecture Implementation on cifar10 Dataset](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Neural-Network-Architecture-Implementation-for-Image-Classification/blob/main/MiniVGGNet_cifar10.ipynb)

* It's multi-class classification task - (Predict between 10 different classes)
* MiniVGGNet Architecture has been used for Image Classification on cifar10 dataset.
